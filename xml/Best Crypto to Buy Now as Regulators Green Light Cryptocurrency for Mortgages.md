# Best Crypto to Buy Now as Regulators Green Light Cryptocurrency for Mortgages

A pivotal shift has landed: the Federal Housing Finance Agency now mandates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to draft plans for accepting cryptocurrency as collateral. This sea change bridges the gap between decentralized wealth and traditional home financing, while unlocking mortgages for those whose net worth lives on the blockchain.

## US Regulator Paves Way for Crypto as Mortgage Collateral

A US housing regulator now requires mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to plan accepting cryptocurrency as loan collateral. This policy shift means borrowers can use crypto held on approved US exchanges without selling it first.

Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood praised the move, calling its potential impact on housing and crypto markets underappreciated. She believes it solves a key barrier for crypto investors often denied mortgages due to concentrated digital wealth.

Wood suggested crypto holders might transfer assets like Bitcoin to exchanges such as Coinbase to secure previously unattainable home loans. This directly addresses how traditional lending sidelined borrowers with non-standard assets.

However, requiring crypto holdings on centralized exchanges sparked immediate criticism from some in the community. Critics argue this mandate contradicts core crypto principles favoring decentralization over controlled platforms.

The Federal Housing Finance Agency directive aims to broaden sustainable homeownership access while improving risk assessments. It includes safeguards like volatility discounts and board oversight for stability.

Using volatile crypto for mortgages could stimulate housing demand but also introduces new market risks. This development marks a significant step blending digital assets with conventional real estate finance.

Ark Invest has long advocated for crypto's role in traditional finance, backing its disruptive potential. Wood remains notably bullish, previously forecasting Bitcoin could reach $1.5 million by 2030.

## Bitcoin Price Analysis

The daily Bitcoin chart reveals two key levels for traders to watch: resistance at $109,000 and support at $100,000. Bitcoin has struggled to break above the $109K level since rallying from early June, with sellers consistently defending this area. On the other hand, the $100K level, marked by the June 22 low, has acted as a strong support zone, where buyers stepped in to prevent further declines.

After a solid bounce from $100K, marked by significant green volume, Bitcoin has returned toward the $109K resistance. The smaller candles observed under this resistance suggest a consolidation phase, with bulls testing the ceiling and sellers still active.

If Bitcoin manages to break above $109K with increased volume, it could signal a bullish breakout and potential for new highs. However, if it fails to break through this resistance, a pullback toward the $100K support could follow.

### Key Bitcoin Price Indicators

| Date       | Key Level   | Price Action | Volume Analysis |
|------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Early June | $100,000    | Strong bounce| High green volume |
| June 22    | $100,000    | Support test | Moderate volume  |
| Current    | $109,000    | Resistance   | Consolidation   |

## Why Consider Bitcoin Investment Now?  

### Historical Performance vs. Future Potential  
Bitcoin's limited 21 million supply creates inherent scarcity, while its 15-year track record demonstrates resilience through multiple market cycles. Recent institutional adoption and technological advancements suggest growing legitimacy.

As a non-correlated asset, Bitcoin can enhance portfolio resilience. Studies show 2-5% allocation can improve risk-adjusted returns during inflationary periods.  

### Regulatory Developments  
The 2024 SEC approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs marks a watershed moment, potentially attracting $100B+ in institutional capital over the next decade.

|---------|------------|------------------|------------|
| DCA     | Medium     | 10-15% annualized | Low        |

| Active Trading | Very High | Variable       | High       |

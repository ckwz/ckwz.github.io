## Key Enhancements Explained

### BNB Integration for Staking Rewards

The inclusion of **BNB (Binance Coin)** as a staking collateral option opens new earning opportunities for asset holders. Users can now:

- Earn staking rewards while maintaining exposure to BNB's value
- Use BNB as collateral to borrow various cryptocurrencies
- Offset borrowing costs through earned rewards

This integration follows BNB's proven track record of maintaining market stability and its established position within the Binance ecosystem.

### Automated Margin Protection System

The newly introduced **'Auto-Replenishment'** feature addresses one of the most critical challenges in collateralized lending:

**How it works:**
1. System monitors real-time collateral ratios
2. Triggers automatic replenishment when approaching maintenance thresholds
3. Transfers assets from spot wallet to loan account
4. Maintains position integrity during volatile market conditions

Users can activate this feature through the asset overview section of their Binance account. It's crucial to maintain adequate spot wallet balances to ensure successful execution during market volatility.

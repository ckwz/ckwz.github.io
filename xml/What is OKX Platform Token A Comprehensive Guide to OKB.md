- **Value backed by OKX performance**: The token's utility and demand correlate with OKX's growth and service expansion.

2. **Priority Access to New Features**

## FAQ: Common Questions About OKB

### 1. Can OKB Be Used Outside the OKX Platform?

Yes, OKB is accepted by select merchants and integrated into third-party wallets like Trust Wallet and MetaMask. However, its primary utility remains within the OKX ecosystem.

### 2. How Does OKB's Burn Mechanism Work?

OKX uses 30% of quarterly profits to buy back OKB from the open market, which is then permanently burned. This reduces supply and theoretically increases value over time.

### 3. Is OKB a Good Long-Term Investment?

Its deflationary model and OKX's market position make OKB attractive for long-term holders. However, diversification is advised due to crypto market volatility.

### 4. How Secure Is OKB?

As an ERC-20 token, OKB benefits from Ethereum's security. OKX also employs cold storage for reserves and undergoes regular audits by third-party firms.

### 5. What Sets OKB Apart From BNB or HT?

OKB's higher burn rate (30% vs. 20% for BNB/HT) and aggressive ecosystem expansion differentiate it. However, BNB's broader adoption remains a challenge.
